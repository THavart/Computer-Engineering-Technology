# Computer-Engineering-Tech
Overview of the majority of the code base that I created during my academic career in Computer Engineering Technology at Algonquin College.

Categories are broken down as follows:

- ASP.NET/MVC:
    .NET Enterprise Application Development uses C#, ASP.NET, and MS SQL to create databases and distributed storage in a cloud
    computing environment (Microsoft Azure). Basic UI was created and displayed for client interaction.
    
- Algorithms
    Numerical Computing involved the creation of complex algorithms in C++, including Lagrange interpolation, Linear Regression,
    and Bin/Hex/Dec converter. 
    
    Further sorting algorithms such as MergeSort have been coded in Java. Others to be added shortly.
    
 - Arduino (Teensy Board)
    Interfacing, register manipulation and 7-Segment Display code based on the Teensy Arduino boards.
    
 - Assembly Code (Motorola Freescale 68HC12)
    Basic functions created such as arrays, register manipulation BCD Counters, and Hex Displays.

 - C++ (Visual Studio 2015)
    Testing the functionality of C++ including polymorphism, inheritance, and object-oriented programming techniques.
    
 - C Programming
    Compiler creation from scratch (Buffer, Scanner, Symbol Table, Parser) based on specification sheet provided.
    Basic Decryptor and Particle Generator using OpenGL provided as well.
    
 - CHEO Project Base Code
    Team was tasked to create a web application to help those who were suffering from cardiac ailments at CHEO to become more active.
    Tool used WordPress and custom plugins for activity selection and UI. Tool was created to give parents and children alike ideas
    as to how their children could maintain a higher level of activity without being able to view their restrictions set upon them
    by their physicians.
 
 - Database
   Breakdown of various technologies used throughout the Computer Engineering Technology program for information storage. This includes:
   Oracle, MS SQL, MySQL, NoSQL, MS Access, Microsoft Azure. Code provided are mostly examples of queries that were used to access local
   databases.

 - Java (Eclipse/Netbeans IDE)
   Object Oriented programming practices were learned and incorporated into various programs. Polymorphism, inheritance and various data
   structures were a core concept in producing the code.
   
 - Javascript
   Celsius Conversion Applet and Calculator Applet created using JFrame, JPanel, and other basic functionalities of Javascript.
   
 - Real-Time
   Socket Application simulated through the use of QNX, C Code. 
 
 - Smart Network
   Final year project that took on the task of creating a IT Tool that would be able to track IT Tickets to specific computers, and 
   prioritize tickets based on proximity to the main office, and maps out a route to solve issues based off priority and location.
   
   This was done by scraping MAC Addresses from the computers that sent the tickets, and were limited to those who connect via ethernet cable.
   Information was gathered and provided inside a web app that used a custom plug-in that could present data based off a custom map of the T
   Building at Algonquin College.
